# Torre, Engineering - Technical Test v.1.1

## Live Demo

[Live Demo Link](https://julianrvillamil.github.io/Torre-Engineering-technical-test/)

## Future Features

If I had more time, I would have implemented the following features:

- Animate the favorite button by filling it to provide feedback to the user.
- Animate the sidebar to make it collapsible.
- Connect to a backend, as it currently stores the information in localStorage.
